## Project 1 - SQL -  Electric_Vehicles_WA_Data_Analytics

Contains 5 queries

* Initial query:
    + Look for all data with the most recent values that are registered in WA
* Question 1:
    + Which counties had the highest amount of electric vehicles? Also, form a CTE from the previous query.
* Question 2:
    + What are the top 5 counties that have the highest totals in EV, and calculate the percentage they are in within the county EV population?
* Question 3:
    + How has the EV Population for King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties changed? Also, what is the percentage of EVs in their respective county population?
* Question 4:
    + What is the fourth highest Electric Vehicle Population county registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) recently?


## Project 2 - Python -  Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

Perform various codes for correlation analysis

* Setting up:
    + Imported necessary libraries (tidyverse, caret, ggplot2, randomForest, tensorflow).
* Cleaning:
    + Encoded categorical variables for model training.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    + Visualized distributions of key variables using histograms and boxplots.
    + Identified correlations between variables using a heatmap.
* Model Training & Evaluation:
    + Implemented multiple machine learning models: Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
    + Evaluated models using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
* Cross-Validation & Optimization:
    + Applied K-Fold Cross-Validation to improve model performance.
    + Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.

## Project 3 - Power BI -  Data_Professional_Survey_Breakdown

Visualize data professional survey collected by Alex Freberg

* Visualization 1:
    + Treemap of countries that respondents reside
* Visualization 2:
    + Cluster bar chart of job titles by average salary
* Visualization 3:
    + Count of distinct survey respondents and their average age
* Visualization 4:
    + Stacked column chart for a breakdown of languages favored by job title
* Visualization 5:
    + Donut chart of difficulty to break into the data industry
* Visualization 6:
    + Gauges for how happy respondents were happy with

## Project 4 - SQL & Draw.io -  Inventory Management Systems for ARPGs

* Draw.io:
    + Developed a comprehensive database design incorporating both conceptual and logical models, detailing cardinalities and inter-table relationships to optimize data integrity and access
* SQL Server Management Studio:
    + Authored SQL scripts to construct database tables, ensuring proper implementation of primary (PK) and foreign key (FK) constraints along with suitable data types to support system requirements
    + Populated tables with manually generated sample data to facilitate testing and demonstration of database functionality
    + Crafted several SQL queries to enable efficient item identification and retrieval for player inventories, enhancing user experience and system responsiveness
 * PPT:
    + Created a polished presentation to outline project scope, design rationale, and functionality, effectively communicating the system's capabilities and architecture to stakeholders
